# FORCESEEK Hints

## What FORCESEEK Does

The `FORCESEEK` table hint tells the optimizer: "You must use an index seek to access this table. Do not scan."

```sql
Select i.Id
From ImgImage i With (NoLock)
Join ImgRxImgAssoc IR With (NoLock, FORCESEEK) On i.Id = IR.ImgId
```

The optimizer will find an index on `ImgRxImgAssoc` that supports a seek on `ImgId` and use it. If no such index exists, the query fails with an error rather than falling back to a scan.

## When FORCESEEK Appears in Code

FORCESEEK is almost always a **band-aid**. Its presence tells a story:

1. Someone observed a slow query with a scan on this table
2. They forced a seek and performance improved
3. The underlying reason for the scan was never addressed

The scan usually happens because of:

- [[LEFT JOIN OR Anti-Pattern]] — OR conditions prevent the optimizer from choosing seeks
- [[Non-SARGable Predicates]] — function-wrapped columns can't seek
- [[UNION ALL Views]] — the optimizer can't push predicates through the view cleanly
- Bad cardinality estimates — the optimizer thinks a scan is cheaper because it overestimates the result size
- Stale statistics — the optimizer's row estimates are based on outdated data

## Why It's a Band-Aid

FORCESEEK addresses the **symptom** (scan instead of seek) but not the **cause** (why the optimizer chose a scan). Problems with this approach:

### 1. It Overrides the Optimizer's Judgment
Sometimes the optimizer chooses a scan because it IS the better plan. If the table is small or the query returns a large percentage of rows, a scan + filter is faster than thousands of individual seeks. FORCESEEK removes this flexibility.

### 2. It Masks the Real Problem
The presence of FORCESEEK should trigger investigation: *why* doesn't the optimizer choose a seek naturally? Fixing the root cause benefits all queries on the table, not just the one with the hint.

### 3. It Creates Fragile Plans
If the index that supports the seek is dropped, renamed, or reorganized, the query fails outright instead of degrading gracefully to a scan.

### 4. It Doesn't Compose
FORCESEEK forces a seek on one table, but if the surrounding query structure is broken ([[LEFT JOIN OR Anti-Pattern|LEFT JOIN + OR]], for example), the optimizer still produces a suboptimal plan for everything else.

## The Right Approach

1. **See FORCESEEK → investigate why the scan happens**
2. Fix the root cause (refactor the query pattern, fix the predicates, update statistics)
3. Remove the FORCESEEK and verify the optimizer chooses seeks naturally
4. If the optimizer still scans after the root cause fix, THEN keep the hint — but now it's a deliberate choice, not a band-aid

## When to Keep FORCESEEK

- **Parameterized queries with extreme cardinality variance**: The optimizer might choose a scan based on the average case, but seeks are better for 99% of executions. If you can't use [[Parameter Sniffing|local variables]] or `OPTION (RECOMPILE)`, FORCESEEK is a reasonable backstop.
- **Known stale statistics**: If you can't update statistics frequently enough and the optimizer makes wrong choices, FORCESEEK stabilizes the plan.
- **Transitional**: Keep it during a phased refactoring to prevent regressions, then remove it once the full fix is in place.

## Real-World Example

In [[lsp_ImgGetListOfTopXImagesToMove]] (v6), both `ImgRxImgAssoc` and `ImgCanImgAssoc` have `FORCESEEK` hints. These were added because the [[LEFT JOIN OR Anti-Pattern]] caused the optimizer to scan these association tables. The real fix is the UNION refactoring, which converts the LEFT JOINs to INNER JOINs — allowing the optimizer to naturally seek on each association table. After the UNION refactor, we keep the hints initially for safety but plan to test without them to verify natural seek selection.

## Related Concepts

- [[LEFT JOIN OR Anti-Pattern]] — the most common root cause when you see FORCESEEK
- [[Non-SARGable Predicates]] — another reason the optimizer can't seek
- [[UNION ALL Views]] — predicate pushdown failures through views cause unnecessary scans
- [[Query Store Triage]] — look for plans with high reads that might have been "fixed" with FORCESEEK
